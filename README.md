# Artifacts of the ADS Bug-Fix Pattern Study


## Introduction

This is the first bug-fix pattern study in the ADS domain. Our proposed hierarchical classification of ADS bug-fix pattern study includes 15 syntactic and 27 semantic bug-fix patterns, as well as root causes, symptoms, modules, sub-modules, related algorithms, and detailed bug-fix actions. This taxonomy is instrumental for developers, testers, and researchers in developing automated bug detection and repair tools for ADS.

The **published paper** (currently unreleased) of this ADS Bug-Fix Pattern Study will be available at [ACM FSE 2025](https://doi.org/10.1145/3715733). Now you can access the **pre-print version** of this paper at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx).

The **artifacts** of this project are also available at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14776291.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14776291)
